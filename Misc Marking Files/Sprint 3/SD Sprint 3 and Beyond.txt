Sprint SDP 3 and Beyond Meeting with Richard - 28/08/2020

This Sprint:
- Delete variant of insert. Default Cron job which calls php script. Also include one with user setting. If cron runs every hour then user cannot sync less than that time.
- System must determine if we need to run sync via a setting which is course specific. Also sensible default to sync once a day. Use drop down: once day,once a week
- Manual sync button also. Show changes before commiting: html table:green rows people to be added red rows removed and tickboxes.Maybe an accordian.

Next Sprint probably:
- An overall log and also course specific level log
- Integrate with login moodle system. If login to moodle and then our project then auto logs in. Require Auth. If not logged in then redirects into moodle.
- If user has lecturer access to course then they will automatically see that course and no others.
- If admin then you can see all courses
